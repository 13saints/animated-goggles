Early in the morning before falling asleep, I watched **Sorcery in the Big City** ![sorcery in the big city](https://www.anime-planet.com/images/anime/covers/sorcery-in-the-big-city-9373.jpg?t=1512127747). Only one ep is out as of now (it is a combination of the first two epsiodes.) enjoyed the premise, enjoyed the artwork.. enjoyed the fact that it's set in New York City&mdash;it gave me flashbacks to my time there. strange to see people in new york speak japanese.  Not a high stakes kind of anime so far, enjoyed the slice of life aspects. quick character development with Akira reminiscing about her father and Emma becoming a waterfall. enjoyed Apple running on buildings, doing some gravity mockery. also the Killer-B cameo, I did notice.

**Noblesse** S1E1 ![noblesse](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimage.tmdb.org%2Ft%2Fp%2Fw300%2FtnIfTMaig2FmsOSL5wEH3rYofJN.jpg&f=1&nofb=1) Immediately liking the redhead, the director, and the guard. The master, front and center on the cover... don't know about him. He seems like a kid, but I know he is really old.

Good start. Liking the premise.
