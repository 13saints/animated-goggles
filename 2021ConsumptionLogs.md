Early in the morning before falling asleep, I watched **Sorcery in the Big City** ![sorcery in the big city](https://www.anime-planet.com/images/anime/covers/sorcery-in-the-big-city-9373.jpg?t=1512127747). Only one ep is out as of now (it is a combination of the first two epsiodes.) enjoyed the premise, enjoyed the artwork.. enjoyed the fact that it's set in New York City&mdash;it gave me flashbacks to my time there. strange to see people in new york speak japanese.  Not a high stakes kind of anime so far, enjoyed the slice of life aspects. quick character development with Akira reminiscing about her father and Emma becoming a waterfall. enjoyed Apple running on buildings, doing some gravity mockery. also the Killer-B cameo, I did notice.

**Noblesse** S1E1 ![noblesse](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimage.tmdb.org%2Ft%2Fp%2Fw300%2FtnIfTMaig2FmsOSL5wEH3rYofJN.jpg&f=1&nofb=1) Immediately liking the redhead, the director, and the guard. The master, front and center on the cover... don't know about him. He seems like a kid, but I know he is really old.

Good start. Liking the premise.

2020-01-04 watched s1e1 of **The Ancient Magus Bride**.

Watched s1e2 of Noblesse:

```
i've been very intrigued by the first couple of episodes of noblesse. ep1
introduces some of the main characters. it introduces the threat posed by one
bloody gang. three likeable characters are introduced: the director, the guard,
and the redhead. three plotlines, at least, are going on: the guard, the
modified human as we learn he is from ep2, is trying to stay low; the director,
who's just been placed in that role, is trying to serve his master who's woken
up from a long sleep (this master is so far in the background, but the cover art
has him front and center, so i am guessing he is going to play a major major
role in the future. 

ep2 provides more character development and background. we learn that the guard
is a modified human, a Wolverine like figure---totally going on board with the
x-men trope, which explains why he is able to hold his own against superhuman
creatures. 

the bullies show up again. they don't need character development. they serve
two purposes: show how strong the guard is, and how good the redhead is.

we learn a little about a mcguffin: the missing coffin. this gives some DIO
vibes. 

we have the entry of 2 new characters: nobles as they are called. it will be
interesting to see what they are up to. apparently they have come to investigate
what happened in the previous month, in which the guard defended those he was in
charge of looking after. i think these two nobles, although they have a vampiric
essence, are good. they are clearly powerful. don't know about the girl, but the
boy sure is powerful. there is some foreshadowing about the destruction they
might bring in wanting to do good. interesting. i will be watching.

characters: guard M-21, raizel, regis, seira, frankenstein, yusuke.

predictions. yusuke will grow into something powerful. he is not superhuman, but
he is able to hold his own against multiple bullies. 

raizel is the master here, but he has been in the background so far. he has not
shown his powers yet, however, through his looks he is able to get M-21 to take
actions. M-21 clearly has high regards for him. Raizel has shown no resistance
so far to whatever the humans have wanted. They want to play with him, he says
yes. Yosuke recommends that Regis and Seira stay at the director's place, he
says yes. The day he says no, it will be something to watch.  

Think of this as a prologue and two chapters so far. Multiple named characters
have been introduced already, and the plot is getting complicated. In a good
way. About 12 named characters already. 

Comments on the structure: Prologue: fights and survivors. high school tropes
girls hot guy hot guard. destruction, likeable cast. injured protagonist. The
main tension of ep1 was to show M-21 struggle with balancing staying low and
protecting the children. The punch came with him intervening to stop the
bullies. The tension for ep2 revolved around the guard trying to figure out what
was going on with the introduction of the two nobles Regis and Seira. M-21 shows
his loyalty for humans in his conversations with the nobles. Regis followed M-21
to ask him information about the attack. It seems all Regis is trying to do is
get information that will help him protect humans. Upon confirming that M-21 is
not a weak human, but rather a modified human, a human-monster, Regis unleashed
(some) of his power. Here, the bullies attacking the others helped force unity
of direction for Regis and M-21 who immediately went to attend the situation.
The Regis vs M-21 battle had to be the locus for this episode; the rest of the
episode was built around that. However, it did not end with a decisive punch.
They did not fight it all out. Instead they went to face the bullies. Notice, at
any moment, they were strong enough to kill the bullies off, but the tension in
this scene comes from the necessity to engage to the minimum necessary extent.
Lucky for them, there is a normal human in Yosuke who is there capable enough to
handle the necessary. Some backstory, some character development, some plot
advancement: the episode did fine.

* <2021-01-05 Tue> Noblesse rec2.
# (c) 2021 ag3381595759. This section is licensed under [[Kakashi Public License v1.0]].
some very well choregraphed fight scenes took place in eps3-6. m-21 got
discovered by cranz's team. he held on for a while but was clearly outmached.
regis interfered. m21 did not realized the full power of regis, and interfered
back, putting himself between shark and regis.

so m21 is captured and interrogated. he does not buckle, and instead tries to
find out information about his comrades. i like how he is the main main
character so far, but he is not the strongest, and also not the most prominent.
regis turns out to be stronger. he did say that the nobles have become weaker,
however, regis and seira are plenty strong.

the show does a good job of characterizing a number of the antagonists. tao and
tekio for ex, it is hard to watch them get killed. shark had no redeeming
qualities. so the show does put a character like that in, one who is a true
villain. and then there's cranz, man with a mission, but willing to do anything
to advance his position. i would really have liked him to not betray the
character that was getting built up for him. i would have liked to see him flee
with his comrades once raizel came into the scene and demonstrated his
abilities. that would have shown more character complexity.

hammer reminded me of gary from the white tigers in beyblade. but this fat guy
actually showed some prudence. in some ways he reminds me of choji form naruto
too. but evil. just quietly fluffing around in the background, caring about
nothing but food, but then regis comes in to land a decisive blow on shark, and
at the last moment, he intervnes, throwing his explosives at regis. then he
advises shark to take him seriously. and when even after the power up shark has
trouble dealing with regis, hammer brings yosuke and kase down, and forces regis
to stand down. 

seira has quite a likeable character. she had been holding back far more than
her counterpart, however, when she realized regis was in danger, she finally
showed her power. she held her own against hammer, or well, hammer was able to
hold his own against seira. but then she pulled out her scithe, and it was gg.

frankenstein was quite something as well. he unleashed his power when teiko
muttered something about dealing with his master. that was a great scene to
watch. no response to him saying he was going to kill frankenstein. but deal
with the kid? no fucking way! but the show had humanized teiko so much so far,
it was going to be painful to watch him die. fortunately, seira showed up at
this moment, and teiko pleaded to seira to send his apologies to yosuke for
dragging him into this matter. seira also asked frankenstein if he was planning
to kill teiko---this makes me feel she did not kill hammer. frankenstein is
interesting.

the real star of the last episode, however, was raizel. he was at a completely
different power level. mind control, some bloodbending like ability. and he's
started to talk a little more. he showed m21 some of the werewolf like powers he
possesses. this is going to be quite fun to watch.

the core of these episodes was to let raizel have the opportunity to shine.
which he did. 

ep7 was a filler for the most part. it was quite fun watching raizel ordering
everyone to help yosuke find a way to express his infatuation with seira. what i
disliked was how kase and yosuke's memories were wiped. it is a bit like using a
time machine to undo events, or a bit like having seemingly consequential things
happen in a dream. it will be interesting to see how this plays out. it would
have been interesting to see what would have happened if yousuke did not agree
to their memories being rewritten. would the noblesse have forced the rewrite
anyway, citing security concerns? and now that the rewriting has taken place, it
will be intersting to see what residual consequences this has. i am reminded of
julia from book2 of the magicians.

my my, did things go off kilter! i finished watching the entire first season,
the 13 episodes available, and i have a lot to complain about. but first, the
good.

the action sequences are good. the story does not become boring. the stakes
always appear to be high (although, it is not really the case---more on that
later) and that makes it pausing hard. 
i also like how noble the noble lords are. rael's brother slashing himself when
rael interrupts the fight and distracts frankenstein so he gets injured is one
example of something i liked. just honorable fighting.

the problems come in plenty as well.
1. whatever happened to M21 trying to figure out the names of his comrades?
   whatever happened of his promise? has that line been abandoned after tao was
   unable to find anything?
2. M21's werewolf powers were no alluded to again.
3. frankenstein... did we need another mystery to be interjected? frankenstein
   is a lot of fun to watch. but we don't know how he got all those powers? what
   was the point of the backstory if it had to be left open?
4. more on stakes: the tensions are ultimately artificial. raizel can just come
   in at any time and overpower everybody with his blood storm. even the
   lordlady who was being propped up as the ultimate boss did little against
   raizel. no matter what happens elsewhere, raizel stands up and everythign
   stops.
5. no major deaths.
6. only the smaller nobles die. and there are no consequences for that. raizel
   knights come in and kill when regis is trying to force something smoother,
   and then, nothing happens. the nobles overpower but do not kill.
7. why did raizel go into this 820 year long sleep?
8. how did frankenstein find him? (i guess in order to find these answers, i
   will need to watch the ova. but this is season 1 for crying out loud.
   shouldn't this be the start?)
9. kase and yosuke are total background characters in the second half.
10. the union. whatever they are? no explanation at all.

looks like this was a season set up with the assumption of a sequel. there was
no attempt at all to tie ends. only 1 end was tied, and that's the proving of
innocence of raizel. but did that need 820 years. couldn't the nobles have
discovered the coffin earlier? (btw, this finding the coffin was a total DIO
ripoff. not that i have a problem with that.)
