Christopher Hitchens said something along the following lines: The truth doesn't lie, but when it does lie, it lies somewhere in the middle. Hitch was a chainsmoker and his alcohol tolerance was the stuff of legends. In December 2011, at age 62, he fell to pneumonia while undergoing treatment for oesophagal cancer. 

Christopher's brother, Peter Hitchens, debates drug policy [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDtIZZiySgA). He argues that preventing addictive behavior is a matter of willpower and that strict penalties ought to be applied on drug offenders for deterrance. The opposition argues that the genetic component to addiction cannot be ignored and that drug courts in conjunction with therapy should lead the way instead. 

Late Hitch's quote came to my mind. Both sides are correct to a degree, and different people need to hear different presentations. Policymakers need to consider the second argument. They look ways to help nonviolent drug offenders out; it is a bit much to have someone put behind bars when all he did was engage in a private act of consuming a prohibited substance without negative externalities, let alone the matter of personal liberty. Portugal should be a required case study. On the other hand, individuals, regardless of whether the second argument is true, must act as though the first is true and exercise personal control, only seeking medical respite when behavioral modifications fail.

*Footnote:* 
Peter Hitchens got under my skin a bit. On the one hand he supports drug ciminalization, but on the other hand he argues mask mandates are a draconian erosion of liberty.
