# Polar 2.0 is worse than Polar 1.0

I was really beginning to enjoy using Polar Bookshelf. The 350MB cloud cap was not enough for me---my documents offline already exceeded 500MB---but I did not mind using the program offline. There was a `.polar` folder I needed to maintain a backup of. The promise was that I could simply physically transfer the folder to a different computer, install Polar, and get on with my business. 

I could highlight my documents with various colors. I could comment on the side. The pagemarking system was a little clunky to implement, but it was still the best kind of pagemarking I had seen. Tagging worked well enough. The progress bars were a nice touch. It worked.

I had just over a hundred documents. This worked better than simply having a folder full of PDF files. I was beginning to become deeply aware of what I was assimilating from digital documents, something I was sorely missing from the days of widespread use of physical codices. 

But Polar 2.0 does away with the offline system. Everything is on the cloud. I cannot open my document without internet access---that is a MAJOR drawback. I spend data downloading files. I spend data uploading them to Polar (something I don't see the benefit of.) It is slow. It inverts colors on PDF files by default turning pictures into monstrosities. The word "bookshelf" has been dropped off the name. The new icon evokes no association. There's no directory containing actual files. 

It does what I don't need. It skips what I do need. What the hell am I supposed to do with this demonstrably inferior product?
