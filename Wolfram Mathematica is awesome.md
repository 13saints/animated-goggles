Wolfram Mathematica has been a major addition to my life this year. Python used to be my go-to language, but now with free license for Mathematica on offer, it's not the case anymore. I enjoy using Mathematica for a number of reasons. Here are some of them.

* Syntax that's closer to what mathematicians use. Compare `ppois(q, lambda, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)` in R to `CDF[PoissonDistribution[lambda], k]` in Mathematica. The Mathematica code is concise and better readable.
* Wolfram Knowledgebase.
* Thousands of built-in functions.
